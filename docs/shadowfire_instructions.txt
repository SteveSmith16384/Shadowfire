 INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the world's first-ever icon-driven adventure: Shadowfire - rescue
from Zoff V.

MISSION BACKGROUND
At this time starships can jump from star to star using their hyper-drives.
They are unable to jump into a planet's orbit. General Zoff, traitor to the
Empire exploits this situation. His skyfortress, Zoff V, lurks behind the
perilous asteroid belts which ring planet Norgol. There he plots the conquest
of the Empire's peaceful worlds.
However, plans for a new kind of starship do exist. They propose a craft
called Shadowfire, able to jump from planet to planet. If Zoff had the plans he
could ravage any part of the empire. If the Emperor had the plans he could
destroy Zoff.
Unfortunately, Ambassador Kryxix has the plans, hidden in a micro-disc
embedded in his spine. The ambassador is held captive aboard Zoff V. In a few
short hours Zoff's inquisitors will discover the plans, unless the Empire's
Enigma team can rescue Kryxix.
Enigma is a shadowy organisation dedicated to the Emperor's service. Its
operatives are the cream of the Empire's legions, the worst of its criminal
scum or the latest development in cybernetics. Its mission controllers are
dedicated. That is why you have been chosen to head this mission. The Empire
commands! Your team awaits!

GAME OBJECTIVES
You have one hour and forty minutes to accomplish the Shadowfire mission.
Using the abilities of the Enigma team you must locate and rescue Ambassador
Kryxix, apprehend and capture General Zoff, then capture or destroy the
starship Zoff V. You can accomplish these tasks in any order!
The mission opens with the Enigma craft moored alongside Zoff V. Your first
task is to beam some or all of your team aboard using the abilities of the
droid Manto.
